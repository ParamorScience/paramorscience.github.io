Work with the PARAMOR project
=============================

One way to participate in the PARAMOR project is to contribute to the various software development projects in AMO physics which are related to the project. Chiefly this includes software developed by the [UK-AMOR consortium](https://www.ukamor.com/#/software).

Also, we will have a number of funded PhD and post-doc positions which will be advertised here. 

Currently we have one open position:

[PhD project: re-engineering scientific software for the future](phd1.md)
